# SurvAnalysis_Pub
Determining the best method for survival analysis in the case of continuous variables.

In order to do this we will look at a few different methods

1. Quantile based cut-off at the median
2. Quantile based cut-off at 25th and 75th percentile
3. Scanning approach - finding optimal cut-off
4. Cox Regression
5. Gaussian-Mixture model assuming 2 distributions
6. Jess Method


you can run the code by going into the code directory and typing 

```Rscript driver.R ```
