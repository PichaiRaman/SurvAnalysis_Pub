# SurvAnalysis_Pub
Determining the best method for survival analysis in the case of continuous variables.

In order to do this we will look at a few different methods

1. Quantile based cut-offs
2. Scanning approach - finding optimal cut-off
3. Distribution specific cut-off - Determining the actual distribution and creating cut-offs based on this
4. Z-score based cut-off


you can run the code via 

```Rscript driver.R ```
